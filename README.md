# Hybrid Intelligence KE Repository
This repository contains material for the work on "Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence": ontologies, scenarios, task descriptions, etc. 

1. Domain Layer : knowledge roles for Hybrid Intelligence scenarios (high-level ontology)  [HIO-v2.draw.png](HIO-v2.drawio.png)

2. Task and Inference Layer : HI-specific tasks and subtasks [HITasks.png](HITasks.png)

3. For seven Hybrid Intelligence scenarios, we provide the task decomposition in markdown as well as a visual (flowchart) representation. The task decomposition consists of a description of 'terminology',  'inference steps' and 'tasks'. The HI scenarios are:

- [S1](S1/) Detecting conflicting, non-cooperative Smart Watch Assistants.
- [S2](S2/) Learning Explainable Sequential Behaviors.
- [S3](S3/) Collective Decisions in Law and Economics
- [S4](S4/) Educational Recommenders with Narratives
- [S5](S5/) Knowledge Graphs supporting Machine Intelligence
- [S6](S6/) Co-learning Buildings
- [S7](S7/) Knowledge-aware Museum Guide for Virtual Heritage Exhibitions
