Hybrid Intelligence Ontology: Knowledge Graph & Semantic Technologies

This repository contains the implementation of an ontology-driven knowledge graph for Hybrid Intelligence (HI). The project demonstrates the integration of semantic technologies with machine learning to represent and query research knowledge.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
	â€¢	Expand and modify an ontology (hi_ontology.ttl) based on extracted concepts from research papers.
	â€¢	Populate the ontology with RDF instances of research papers.
	â€¢	Integrate external Linked Data sources (DBpedia, Wikidata, ORKG).
	â€¢	Perform SPARQL queries, KG embeddings, and link prediction for data insights.
	â€¢	Develop a research proposal based on identified gaps and challenges.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

âœ… Ontology Design: Extended hi_ontology.ttl with new classes, object properties, and data properties.
âœ… Instance Creation: Converted research papers into structured RDF triples.
âœ… Knowledge Graph Integration: Linked ontology concepts to external KGs.
âœ… Semantic Querying: Extracted insights using SPARQL queries.
âœ… KG Metrics & Analysis: Evaluated ontology structure with KG embeddings and metrics.
âœ… Research Proposal: Identified challenges & proposed solutions based on ontology-based reasoning.
