# Hybrid Intelligence KE Repository
This repository contains material for the work on "Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence": ontologies, scenarios, task descriptions, etc. 

## Domain Layer 
- This visualisation shows the various knowledge roles for Hybrid Intelligence scenarios and functions as a high-level ontology  [HIO-v2.draw.png](HIO-v2.drawio.png)
- Also included is the OWL ontology in Turtle syntax [hi_ontology.ttl](HI_ontology.ttl)

## Task and Inference Layer
We list HI-specific tasks and subtasks in this visualisation [HITasks.png](HITasks.png)

## Scenario repository
For seven Hybrid Intelligence scenarios, we provide the task decomposition in markdown as well as a visual (flowchart) representation. The task decomposition consists of a *title*, a *description*, a *visual task decomposition*, *terminology*,  *inference steps* and *tasks*. The HI scenarios currently in the repository are listed below:

- [S1](S1/) Detecting conflicting, non-cooperative Smart Watch Assistants.
- [S2](S2/) Learning Explainable Sequential Behaviors.
- [S3](S3/) Collective Decisions in Law and Economics
- [S4](S4/) Educational Recommenders with Narratives
- [S5](S5/) Knowledge Graphs supporting Machine Intelligence
- [S6](S6/) Co-learning Buildings
- [S7](S7/) Knowledge-aware Museum Guide for Virtual Heritage Exhibitions

To add a new scenario and task decomposition, clone the repository, add a folder "SX" with a README.md file that uses the same layout as the existing scenarios as well as an image showing the visual task decomposition. Add the scenario through a git pull request.
