# Hybrid Intelligence KE Repository
This repository contains material for the work on "Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence" : ontologies, scenarios, task descriptions, etc. 

1. Domain Layer : knowledge roles for Hybrid Intelligence scenarios (high-level ontology)  [HIO-v2.draw.png](HIO-v2.drawio.png)

2. Task and Inference Layer : HI-specific tasks and subtasks [HITasks.png](HITasks.png)

3. For seven Hybrid Intelligence scenarios, we provide the task decomposition in markdown as well as a visual (flowchart) representation. The task decomposition consists of a description of 'terminology',  'inference steps' and 'tasks'. The six HI scenarios are
- [S1](S1/) Detecting conflicting, non-cooperative Smart Watch Assistants.
- [S2](S2.png) Learning Explainable Sequential Behaviors.
- [S3](S3.png) Collective Decisions in Law and Economics
- [S4](S4.png) Educational Recommenders with Narratives
- [S5](S5.png) Knowledge Graphs supporting Machine Intelligence
- [S6](S6.png) Knowledge-aware Museum Guide for Virtual Heritage Exhibitions
- [S7](S7.png) Talking Buildings: urban energy management
